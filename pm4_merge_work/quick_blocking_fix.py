Quick Fix: Analyze and Resolve Over-Blocking Issue
Memphis Civic Market - July 27, 2025v3

Based on diagnostic evidence showing 100% blocking rate, this script:
1. Tests a single contract directly through the critic
2. Identifies specific blocking reasons
3. Applies targeted threshold adjustments
4. Validates the fix works
