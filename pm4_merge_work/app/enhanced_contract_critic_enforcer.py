Enhanced Contract Critic & Market Balance Enforcer - World-Class 50/50 Enforcement

Implements strict blocking enforcement for Memphis civic prediction market:
- All market balance issues are 1.0 weight (blocking)
- Explicit LLM-driven checks: "Would both sides bet this?", "Is this genuinely uncertain?"
- Multi-variant reframing integration
- Complete admin override logging and audit trail
- No drift, no weak spots - only genuinely bettable contracts pass

   - BLOCK ONLY IF: >90% certain (e.g., "Will the sun rise?") or <10% likely (impossible events)
   - Memphis civic events (budget votes, elections, policy decisions) are typically VIABLE
   - Normal political uncertainty and debate = MARKETABLE, not problematic
   - Consider: Would reasonable people disagree about the likelihood?

2. MARKET VIABILITY TEST (RELAXED FOR CIVIC EVENTS):
   - PASS: Standard civic/political events with clear resolution criteria
   - Memphis council votes, elections, policy implementations = VIABLE by default
   - Public information availability is normal for civic events
   - "Insider knowledge" concerns are overblown for public civic processes
   - BLOCK ONLY: Truly private/confidential decisions with no public information

3. CIVIC RELEVANCE CHECK:
   - PASS: Any genuine Memphis civic/political/community event
   - Elections, budget votes, policy decisions, public projects = VIABLE
   - BLOCK ONLY: Obvious nonsense ("Will aliens land?"), purely hypothetical scenarios
   - Real civic events with real consequences = MARKETABLE

4. RESOLUTION CLARITY:
   - PASS: Clear, objective resolution criteria with reliable sources
   - Official votes, election results, policy announcements = CLEAR
   - BLOCK ONLY: Subjective outcomes ("Will people be happier?"), unverifiable claims
   - Standard civic documentation and official announcements = SUFFICIENT"""

ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK - July_25_2025v2 World-Class Enforcement:

**BLOCKING ISSUES (1.0 WEIGHT) - PREVENT PUBLICATION:**

1. PROBABILITY BIAS (BLOCKING):
   - Is this outcome >80% likely or <20% likely based on current facts?
   - Would rational bettors heavily favor one side?
   - Does public information make one outcome near-certain?

2. MARKET VIABILITY (BLOCKING):
   - Would rational bettors take BOTH sides of this bet?
   - Is there genuine uncertainty attracting balanced action?
   - Would this generate real trading interest on both YES and NO?

3. TRADING BALANCE (BLOCKING):
   - Would professional bookmakers list this market?
   - Is this a "dead" market with predetermined outcome?
   - Would traders consider this viable for balanced betting?

4. BIASED FRAMING (BLOCKING):
   - Is the contract framed neutrally without political bias?
   - Does wording artificially skew odds or push agenda?
   - Are terms loaded or leading toward one outcome?

5. UNBETTABLE (BLOCKING):
   - Can this be fairly bet on with clear resolution?
   - Is the outcome genuinely uncertain (not predetermined)?
   - Will resolution be unambiguous?

**QUALITY ISSUES (WEIGHTED BUT NOT BLOCKING):**

6. AMBIGUITY: Clear decision maker, action, timeline, resolution criteria
7. PSEUDO-OSTENSION: Genuine civic drama vs manufactured controversy
8. ARC FATIGUE: Story freshness and narrative value
9. UNCLEAR RESOLUTION: Resolution clarity and dispute potential
